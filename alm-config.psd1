    # FORK CONFIGURATION:
    # To customize this configuration in a fork, create a fork-almconfig.psd1 file
    # in the ALM4Dataverse repository root.
    # Fork configuration is merged with this file (this file's values take precedence).
    # Arrays are concatenated, hashtables are merged.
    # This allows forks to add custom defaults without modifying this template.
    #
    # HOOK SCRIPT PATHS AND [ALM] REPLACEMENT:
    # Hook script paths can use the [alm] placeholder to reference the ALM4Dataverse
    # repository root. For example:
    #   '[alm]/custom-hooks/myScript.ps1' -> executes the script from the fork's copy of ALM4Dataverse
    # This is useful for running custom hook scripts provided by the ALM4Dataverse fork.
    # The placeholder is replaced with the absolute path to the ALM repo root before execution.

    # Solutions to process, in dependency order.
    # Each entry is a hashtable with keys
    # - name: unique solution name.
    # - deployUnmanaged: (optional) boolean indicating whether to deploy unmanaged version.
    # - serviceAccountUpnConfigKey: (optional) name of the environment configuration key containing
    #   the service account UPN to use when activating processes in this solution.
    #   The default is 'DataverseServiceAccountUpn'
    # - solutionCheck: (optional) per-solution PAC checker settings merged with global solutionCheck
    #   settings below. Use enabled = $false to skip checker for a specific solution.
